# f3f-timer

Race Management software for F3F Racing

This software is for maintaining the list of pilots, rounds and scores during an f3f race.
If you don't know what f3f is, then see http://www.rc-soar.com/bmfa_league/f3f.htm

The app does not do the timing itself. This is done using external hardware which connects to the Android device over a USB connection. This is the only way to ensure minimal latency in the timing.

The app currently supports 2 flavours of USB boards. You can either use an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, or a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10748">IOIO<a> to connect hardware to the app.
